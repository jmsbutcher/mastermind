# mastermind
A text-based recreation of the code-breaking board game Mastermind

September, 2013

This was my first non-trivial Java program. I wrote it on the side while taking my Intro to Computer Science class (CSE114) at Stony Brook University, where I was earning my Bachelor's Degree in Physics. The class was taught using Java and I thought it would be a good idea to make my own project, for 3 reasons:

1. It was fun
2. It would help solidify the programming concepts I was learning
3. I could show it off one day

The gameplay is simple:  

The game starts with a randomly-generated 4-digit code.  
You have 10 tries to guess the code.  
After each guess, you receive feedback symbols representing correct digits and correct positions  
Use these symbols as clues to help guess the code
